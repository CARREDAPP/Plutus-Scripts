Cardano Recycling DApp


Workflow:
* Household: identity, type, weight and location
* Buyer: type, min volume,
* Payout after Quantity Q.
* Cancel offer(?), Update (buyer updates), Complete (tranches?) 


Datum: pkh (2), quantity, price (kg/total), transID
Will the buyer need to be registered or they can just pay on escrow?
Fees for using the App?
